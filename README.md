# Cracking-WEP-Wi-Fi-Encryption-Using-Wifite2
Performed a hands-on penetration testing lab demonstrating how legacy WEP Wi-Fi encryption can be compromised using automated attack techniques with Wifite2. Captured wireless traffic, executed WEP cracking attacks, and analyzed results to highlight vulnerabilities in outdated wireless security protocols and the importance of migrating to WPA2/WPA3
